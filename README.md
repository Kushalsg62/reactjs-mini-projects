##React Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a curated set of small React applications I built while learning and refining my skills. Each project focuses on a specific concept and showcases how React behaves in practical scenarios. The collection reflects steady progress, curiosity and a growing command of core front-end ideas.

What’s Inside

Independent mini projects, each in its own directory

Clean and readable code structure

Practical demonstrations of:

Component-based design

Hooks (useState, useEffect and others)

Conditional and dynamic rendering

Form handling and controlled inputs

Lists, keys and iterative UI building

Basic state-management approaches

Gradual improvement in logic, structure and styling

Purpose

This repository serves as a compact portfolio of hands-on exploration. Each project is an incremental step in understanding how to design, structure and implement interactive UIs using React. It also acts as a reference point for collaborators and recruiters who want to review my coding style and problem-solving approach.

How to Run a Project

Install dependencies

npm install


Start the development server

npm start

Tech Stack

React

Additional libraries or utilities depending on the project

Roadmap / Future Additions

More mini apps will be added, especially those involving global state, API integration, architectural patterns and performance enhancements.

Various utilities or libraries depending on the project

Future Additions

I plan to expand this repository with additional mini apps that explore more sophisticated ideas such as global state, performance optimization, API integration and design refinement.

React Mini Projects Collection

This repository gathers a series of compact React projects I created while progressing through my learning journey. Each project focuses on a specific concept and serves as a practical illustration of how React behaves in real scenarios. The intent behind this collection is to demonstrate consistent growth, curiosity, and an incremental mastery of the fundamentals.

These projects vary in complexity. Some are straightforward interfaces, while others explore more nuanced ideas like controlled components, state synchronization, event-driven updates and reusable abstractions. Together, they create a cohesive record of hands-on exploration.

What You’ll Find Here

Independent mini applications, each placed in its own directory

Clean and readable code structured for clarity

Practical use of key React ideas such as:

Component-driven architecture

Hooks (useState, useEffect and more)

Conditional rendering

Form handling

Lists, keys and dynamic rendering

Basic state management patterns

Gradual evolution in design and implementation style

Purpose of This Repository

The goal is to present a curated set of small but meaningful exercises that reflect consistent practice. Each project represents a step in understanding how React works behind the scenes and how to translate logic into interactive UI behavior. The collection also functions as a portfolio artifact for recruiters and collaborators who want to see my approach to problem-solving in a front-end environment.

How to Run Any Project

Navigate to the desired project folder

Install dependencies

npm install


Start the development server

npm start


Every project uses a simple development workflow so you can open, inspect, modify and run them without friction.

Tech Stack

React

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML & CSS

Various utilities or libraries depending on the project

Future Additions

I plan to expand this repository with additional mini apps that explore more sophisticated ideas such as global state, performance optimization, API integration and design refinement.

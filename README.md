# REACT MINI PROJECTS COLLECTION

A curated assemblage of compact React applications built during my learning trajectory. Each project is a focused exercise that demonstrates practical application of core React concepts and incremental maturation in engineering judgment.

## WHAT THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS

- Independent mini applications, each located in its own directory
- Concise, idiomatic JavaScript and component-driven structure
- Practical usage of essential React constructs:
  - Component-based design and composition
  - Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
  - Conditional and dynamic rendering
  - Controlled forms and validation patterns
  - List rendering with keys and iterative UI construction
  - Lightweight state-management techniques

## INTENT / VALUE PROPOSITION

This repository functions as both a learning ledger and a professional artefact. It exhibits progressive skill acquisition, pragmatic problem solving, and attention to maintainability. The set is suitable for portfolio review by recruiters, collaborators, or peers wishing to appraise coding style and UI reasoning.
